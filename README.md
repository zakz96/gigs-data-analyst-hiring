# Senior Data Analyst Hiring Challenge EDITED
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Gigs' Senior Data Analyst take-home challenge!
> We will never use the code you provide for anything outside of the interview process! 

You will be working with real, yet anonymized data and will answer questions previously asked by stakeholders.

## Overview
This assignment assesses your business acumen, data analysis skills, and ability to derive actionable insights from telecom usage data. Data loading is handled for you using Jupyter Notebook with DuckDB.

**Time Expectation:** Timebox to 3-4 hours. You may outline additional analysis points you'd tackle with more time.

## About Gigs
Gigs is a platform that lets any business offer phone plans to their users - just like adding payments via Stripe. We provide APIs and tools to power mobile connectivity behind the scenes.

We operate in a B2B2C model: our customers offer these plans to their own end users. As a result, usage behaviour can vary significantly across customer types and verticals.

Gigs supports two main integration modes:
* Connect (White-Label Checkout): Our fully hosted onboarding and checkout experience. This is ideal for businesses that want to go live fast without needing to build telecom flows from scratch.
* API Integration: Gives customers full control to embed Gigs' telecom functionality directly into their own product or backend, allowing for highly customized experiences.

## Business Case
The Connectivity team wants to better understand usage patterns to optimize plan offerings and identify growth opportunities: 
- How much data does a subscription typically consume?
- How does usage look like at different plan data allowances?
- Do subscriptions typically consume consistent amounts of data throughout their lifetime? 

On top of that, the Head of Product approached you:
- Compare the retention pattern for the most recently launched project versus the two older ones.

List follow-up questions for stakeholders and state your assumptions. Note where you'd dive deeper with more time.
